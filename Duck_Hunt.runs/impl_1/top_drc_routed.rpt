-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net my_background/clktest_reg is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin my_background/counter[7]_i_2/O, cell my_background/counter[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT my_background/counter[7]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 18 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    main_cnc/anim_clock/clktest_reg {FDRE}
    main_cnc/anim_clock/counter_reg[0] {FDRE}
    main_cnc/anim_clock/counter_reg[1] {FDRE}
    main_cnc/anim_clock/counter_reg[2] {FDRE}
    main_cnc/anim_clock/counter_reg[3] {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>
